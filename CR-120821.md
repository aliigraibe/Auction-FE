## `components` folder

I'm not sure what `Library` and `Auctions` refer to but make sure you keep your components folder organized as it grows.

## General comments

The code looks good so far. I made some comments with minor suggestions regarding code style.
Most of the changes in the files were automated by Prettier and some extensions I have that sort import statements.
